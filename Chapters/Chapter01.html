<main>
  <p>I’ve always loved apocalypse movies—the kind where everything crumbles, and survivors scavenge for scraps of hope in a broken world. It wasn’t until recently that I realized: I’ve been living in one my whole life! The difference is, in my apocalypse, there’s no epic fight for survival. Instead, it’s a quiet, relentless grind where the simplest places—shops, parks, barbers—are real, but the ones that promise help or safety? Those are myths. They might as well not exist.</p>

  <p>My name is Steven Condra. I was born on December 26, 1971, in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin. It was almost midnight. Muhammad Ali had just knocked out Germanys Jurgen Blin in Zurich, and Benny Hill was topping the UK charts with “Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West).” Life back then might sound like a different world, but from the beginning, it was chaos.</p>

  <p>I was adopted, though no one wanted to explain why. As I grew, I came to understand that my biological parents weren’t allowed to marry—thanks to the Catholic Church’s grip on society. My adoptive family? Let’s just say they brought their own version of the apocalypse. My father drank himself into oblivion, his rage erupting nightly. My mother’s answer to my bed-wetting—triggered by the terror of those nights—was slaps across my face and head. And as if that wasn’t enough, my adoptive grandfather brought horrors in the form of sexual abuse that I couldn’t escape, starting when I was too young to understand it at all.</p>

  <p>Even then, I knew the places that might have helped, didn’t exist for people like me.</p>

  <p>I was seven years old, wearing my communion suit, when I first walked into a Garda station to ask for help, I was wondering the streets while “my family,” were drinking in the greyhound pub Blanchardstown. I walked in, very nervously, terrified even, I remember my legs feeling very weak, like jelly. I can remember them laughing and smiling down at me as I tried to talk to them but they didn’t listen and I left with no help. I might as well have been invisible. The world had shops and parks, sure, but the ones meant for rescue? Those were always out of reach.</p>

  <p>It was alcohol that gave me my first real escape. It wasn’t hard to find—I’d grown up in pubs, after all. At 15, a few Smithwick’s shandies turned me into someone else entirely: funny, confident, the life of the party. For a little while, the apocalypse around me disappeared. But alcohol doesn’t fix a broken world—it just paints over the cracks.</p>

  <p>And that’s how it’s always been: surviving, trying to make sense of a world that works in ways I don’t understand. I don’t write this so you’ll feel sorry for me—I don’t need pity. I need you to understand what it’s like to live in the spaces between: the shops and haircuts are there, sure, but ask about places for help, and you’re chasing myths. That’s what my world has been.</p>

  <p>A lot happened when I was a child, I don't remember much of it accept a lot of snippets of horror. My sister remembers a lot more, I remember talking with My sister on one particular occasion, she reminded me of the time our father had gone to court over a load of fines that he hadn't paid, I think they were parking tickets and stuff like that, but he went to court and was sent to prison. We were only delighted he would be gone for a while, but low and behold, he arrives back in a taxi full of drink, he was so proud of himself, he tells us that the warden showed him around the prison and then let him out the back door. Irish justice. Back to the usual.</p>

  <p>I remember on another occasion him screaming at my mother, this was also a nightly event, I remember being in my bedroom, under the covers, ready to be “asleep,” if anyone walked in. I think they’d been out at a house party in one of my mother's friends’ houses across the road. It would not take you one minute to walk door to door, you could see each other's front door from each other's front door. Anyway he was accusing my mother of talking with another man at this party. That's everything I can remember about the reason why or at least my wonderful fathers reason.</p>

  <p>At one point I remember him dragging her down the stairs by the hair from their bedroom. I was very young and don't remember anything else about it accept the absolute emptiness and fear. This Horrendous behavior was normal in my house. So were these feelings.</p>

  <p>On another occasion I think I was about 15, I attempted suicide. I took tablets I had in my bedroom with a can of beer, Panadol, and stuff like that and went out for a walk. It was just all too much for me. These daily events of drunkenness and abuse on top of the sexual abuse on top of being forced into adoption on top of nobody listening.</p>

  <p>I got over as far as the Kilbarrack Rd. I can't remember exactly where from there. There was two or three local phone boxes within walking distance in those days, guessing I think I walked to the one in Donaghmede but I'm not completely certain. I rang the local fire station and the guy who answered the phone advised me I needed hospitalization. I spoke to him for a minute or two more and then hung up and went back home. Everything was quiet when I got there, as far as I can remember and I just went to bed.</p>

  <p>I seem to have a high tolerance or immunity or something to most drugs, I must do since I'm still here.</p>

  <p>On another occasion when they were fighting. It had gone on for hours as usual, I drank a bottle of household chemicals, I think it was that toilet duck thing, I drank the bottle to stop them fighting. Once they realize what I had done. I had to convince them to take me to the hospital, that's how I remember it.</p>

  <p>I don't remember how I got to the hospital, all I really remember is a nurse giving me something I had to drink and I had to keep drinking a lot of it. I remember at some stage some sort of a mental health professional, psychologist or psychiatrist maybe, I'm not sure, but I do remember them sitting beside me while I was in A&E. Them talking to me. Nothing ever came of that.</p>

  <p>I also remember a shift change, I was lying on my Gurney in A&E with the curtains closed. There was at least three people just outside the curtain discussing me, and when one told the others why I was there, they all had a good laugh. Thank you Beaumont hospital.</p>

  <p>Most of my childhood is just snippets, there are some good snippets but they're few and far between especially when it comes to my mother and father, my adoptive mother and father. Society and normality tells me these people are called my parents, Mum and dad, Mom and Pop, Mother and father, the list goes on, I don't think of these people like that at all. Closest thing I can call them that you can qualify as family is legal guardians.</p>

  <p>Did they raise me? I say no. As a child I had to struggle daily by myself, if I asked for help neither wanted to know. When a friend of mine from the St. John's ambulance brigade passed away in an unfortunate accident at work, They didn't care in the slightest, they gave me no emotional support whatsoever, in fact I remember my father lying on the couch when I told him my friend was in hospital in intensive care and from what I've been told it wasn't looking good. He just put his hand up waved me off and told me not to worry about it they would be grand… When it was time for the funeral he didn't want me to take time off school. The death of someone who was very important to me meant nothing to him. He never actually took an interest in anything I did in school or anywhere else, unless I was in trouble, then I got his full attention.</p>

  <p>I have sympathy for my adoptive mother, she put up with a lot too, but that does not excuse her behavior toward the child she adopted. She used to tell me stories about how she worked in the adoption agency as a carer of sorts, I say of sorts because I'm not exactly sure what her position was. She used to tell me that in those days people who were willing to adopt children also looked to see what the children already had to bring with them, clothing etcetera. She said she used to hide all my stuff so no one would want to adopt me. This I find absolutely staggering, and I'm using the word staggering because I don't want to use bad language. You go to all that trouble to get the child you want just to abuse them, what am I missing here? What do I not understand? Because there's a lot I don't understand.</p>

  <p>Growing up, I struggled to read people the way others seemed to do so naturally. I’d been told so many lies as a child that I couldn’t tell what was truth and what was deception. It left me in a position where I had to take people at face value. If someone said something, I’d believe them — it was just easier than trying to untangle the lies.</p>

  <p>That made me vulnerable at times. People lied to me, and I’d get into trouble for believing them. But there was another side to it, too. Because I trusted people so openly, they often trusted me in return. They could see that I was genuine, and that created connections I wouldn’t have had otherwise. In its own strange way, it worked to my advantage at times.</p>

  <p>One big way it helped was that it made it difficult for other people to read me. What I learned to do with my father was just give him a blank expression and keep it that way. I didn't even realize I was doing that; it just seemed to come naturally. But like any skill or ability, it can be used to your advantage.</p>

  <p>I had always liked to gamble, even as a young lad. My father thought he was a great card player, but in reality, he was just the drunk acting the bully. Cards were played often when I was young. I got involved very young because I wanted to do what my parents were doing. I'm pretty good at math, so learning how the hands worked wasn't too difficult, even quite young.</p>

  <p>I remember a lot of cards — poker usually — in my mother’s uncle’s house in Donegal. From as young as I can remember, I started learning how to play. There were cards in a lot of other family houses also. McKee Barracks was where I spent a lot of Sundays — Sunday mornings — my father, his brother, their father, and their two sisters husbands would be in the mess drinking and playing cards. Grandfather was some sort of a sergeant and my uncle T was a cook. I was too young to play cards at that stage, so I was running wild around the barracks.</p>

  <p>Don’t get me wrong, I was too young to be acting crazy and too naïve anyway. I used to play this game where I’d try to sneak up on the guys at the main gate. Looking back now, it was really funny — or it is from this perspective. If you walked into the main gate of McKee Barracks, the gatehouse was to your right — or the guardhouse — and if you turned left immediately, walked straight down, somewhere in front of you, kind of to the right, was where the mess was, as far as I can remember.</p>

  <p>So imagine this little guy — I could have been 5, or 6, this is in some of my earliest memories, it’s so long ago. But I would actually worry if they would shoot me if they saw me trying to sneak up on them! A child’s mind… it can be a very scary place for silly reasons as well as real reasons.</p>

  <p>At home, there was no advantage. My father’s temper was unpredictable — it could flare over nothing. You’d learn to read the signs: the way his jaw tightened, the way he’d clear his throat before speaking, the way he’d slam a door just a little too hard. That was your warning.</p>

  <p>My mother… I don’t know. Sometimes she seemed to want to help, but other times it was like she couldn’t see me at all. She’d disappear into herself, leaving me to fend for myself. Maybe she thought keeping quiet kept the peace. Maybe it was the only way she knew how to survive him.</p>

  <p>I learned to stay small, to stay quiet, to try to go unnoticed. But no matter how quiet you were, he’d find me. He always did.</p>

  <p>The school wasn’t much better. Kids can smell weakness, and they went after it. I was the boy with the wrong shoes, the wrong bag, the wrong everything. They’d shove me into walls, trip me in the corridor, laugh when I fell. But you have to be philosophical about these things too. Kids are kids — you can’t hold it against them. After all, they’re learning too.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, when I was about 13 or 14, I was in secondary school anyway — I went to Grange Community College, Donaghmede. A lad I knew from school followed me all the way home. It wasn’t after school; I think it was a Saturday afternoon, could have been a Sunday but I had come from the shopping centre. They stayed just a step behind me the whole time, wanting to know what I did to his bike. I had no idea what had happened to his bike and told him so.</p>

  <p>When I reached the front door, he grabbed my shoulder and spun me around. His fist came fast — hit me square in the mouth before I could even think to raise my hands.</p>

  <p>I stumbled back against the door — I actually thought I was going to go through it, the door had two large glass panels, I thought my head was going to smash the large one as it struck it violently from the blow. Just then, my father opened it. He just stood there, staring. I scrambled inside, and they walked into the kitchen together. My so-called father made him tea and listened to him explain how I had damaged his bicycle.</p>

  <p>This was completely untrue. He had loaned his bike to two other friends who had come over to harass me an hour or two earlier before I had gone to the shops. They were on a bike — maybe it was his. Either way, I had nothing to do with it. It was all just an excuse to bully me. My good old father made me apologize to him. How do you like them apples?</p>

  <p>That was the first time I remember realizing: no one was going to save me. Not them. Not the teachers. Not the Gardaí. Not anyone.</p>

  <p>If I wanted to survive, I’d have to save myself.</p>
