      <p>The world outside my window was ordinary: buses groaned past, children in school uniforms dragged their bags. Ordinary for everyone else, maybe. For me, every sound pressed against the silence inside. I had a roof, four walls, and the illusion of safety, but no real anchor. The walls kept out the rain but not the loneliness.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I wondered if anyone else noticed how thin the line was between living and just existing. Shops, parks, bus stops, those were real. But try knocking on the doors that promise help, safety, or justice, and you’ll find them bricked up with silence. That silence became my shadow, following me from one place to the next.</p>

      <p>Growing up, I struggled to read people the way others seemed to do so naturally. I’d been told so many lies as a child that I couldn’t tell what was truth and what was deception. It left me in a position where I had to take people at face value. If someone said something, I’d believe them—it was just easier than trying to untangle the lies.</p>

      <p>This made me vulnerable at times. People lied to me, and I’d get into trouble for believing them. But there was another side to it, too. Because I trusted people so openly, they often trusted me in return. They could see that I was genuine, and that created connections I wouldn’t have otherwise had. In its own strange way, it worked to my advantage at times.</p>

      <p>But that didn’t shield me from everything. I was bullied a lot when I was younger. One moment stands out vividly. I was walking home from Donaghmede shopping centre, and a lad a couple of years older than me followed me all the way to my front door. He kept asking me what had I done to his bike over and over. I kept repeating that I had done nothing to his bike. When we got to the front door, he started punching me, shoving me back against the door as I tried to get away.</p>

      <p>I thought the door opening would save me. My father stood there, and for a split second, I thought he’d finally step in, help me, protect me. But instead, after I ran in behind him, he invited the lad into the house.</p>

      <p>As if that weren’t enough, my father made me apologize to the bully afterward. I didn’t even understand what I was apologizing for. Earlier that day his friend had pushed his bicycle toward me, and I’d stepped out of the way. The bike bounced off a wall and got damaged somehow—not by me, but apparently that didn’t matter. The bully blamed me for it, punched me for it, and then my father made me say sorry to him for it.</p>

      <p>Even now, I don’t understand it. Not the punch, not the apology, and certainly not why my father chose the bully over me in that moment. It wasn’t the punch that hurt the most—it was the betrayal of expecting help and being told instead that I was the one who should be sorry.</p>

      <p>There was one time my father got involved in something I was part of, but even then, it wasn’t really for me. It was for him. We were doing a pub crawl to collect donations—four of us in the car, each with little boxes to shake and try to get a few bob from the drinkers. We needed someone to drive us, and my father was eager to volunteer for this one. Not because he wanted to help us, but because it gave him an excuse to stop at every pub along the way.</p>

      <p>At each stop, we’d pile into the pub, trying to raise money while my father headed straight to the bar for a couple of pints. He’d sit there, loudly telling everyone how great he was for driving us around, soaking in the attention. Meanwhile, we’d finish up with our collections and then stand there, awkwardly waiting for him to finish drinking before we could move on to the next pub.</p>

      <p>I felt embarrassed—no, ashamed. Here I was with my friends from St. John’s Ambulance, trying to do something decent, and my father was making it about himself. I could see it in their eyes, though they didn’t say much. It was humiliating, standing there while he made a show of himself in front of them. It wasn’t just the waiting; it was the whole spectacle of it. Even when he was there, he wasn’t really there for me. It’s the only time I can remember him being part of something I was doing, and yet, it still felt like it wasn’t about me at all.</p>

      <p>It was Aga Khan Day at the RDS, one of the busiest and most chaotic days of the horse show. I was sitting outside the main first aid post, relaxing in an ambulance on what was shaping up to be a nice day. The Anglesey Stand was packed, as it always was on that day. If you were to draw a caricature of it, you’d have people hanging off the edges—it was that busy.</p>

      <p>While I was sitting there, someone came up to me and said, “There’s somebody fainting up there.” I remember thinking, How in the name of God am I going to find a faint up there? Still, I got up and started walking toward the crowd. Before I got far, someone else came running down, grabbed me, and said, “He’s up here, he’s up here!” They led me to the bar.</p>

      <p>Inside, I found a man who’d collapsed. He was a doctor, I learned later, and he’d been drinking despite being on heart medication—something he clearly shouldn’t have been doing. He’d suffered a heart attack. His heart was still beating, but he’d stopped breathing. It was clear what I had to do.</p>

      <p>I went to work, resuscitating him. Those moments are vivid in my memory—not because of panic or adrenaline, but because I felt an overwhelming focus and determination. I wasn’t going to let this man die. Thankfully, I succeeded. I saved his life, and he started breathing again.</p>

      <p>Not long after, the experts arrived, the higher-ups from the St. John’s Ambulance. One of them was a surgeon, and he took over the situation.</p>

      <p>It was alcohol that gave me my first real escape. It wasn’t hard to find—I’d grown up in pubs, after all. At 15, a few Smithwick’s shandies turned me into someone else entirely: funny, confident, the life of the party. For a little while, the apocalypse around me disappeared. But alcohol doesn’t fix a broken world, it just paints over the cracks.</p>

      <p>I started to use it around this time. The first time my father gave me a drink not in private. How this happened was that on my 15th birthday. I was home alone, St. Stephen’s Day. They were at another of my mother’s family Christmas parties, so anyway, depressed and lonely I rang my aunt’s house and spoke to my father. He came and collected me and brought me to the house. I remember him leaving me in a sitting room alone with a glass of beer.</p>

      <p>The first time I bought a beer was a pint of Smithwick’s shandy at a dinner dance in the Grand Hotel, Malahide. It was in aid of the St. John Ambulance brigade and a few of us were allowed join in after the food had been finished and the dancing started. I had only recently joined through a friend at school. I had three pints of shandy that night and it made me feel more than drunk, confident, less anxious, more talkative, all the things we know alcohol does. It was as if a “new, improved me” jumped out of the shadows, louder, braver, freer, a me I didn’t know existed. But the next day all that remained of him was a memory.</p>
