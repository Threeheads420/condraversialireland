    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This website documents my story — the struggles, injustices, and resilience — to shed light on what is happening, inspire others to speak up, and show that no one has to accept being mistreated.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Between the Pages: A Life Lived in the Spaces No One Sees</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"I’ve always loved apocalypse movies — but it took me a lifetime to realize I’d been living in one all along."</p>
  <p>
    This is the story of Steven Michael Condra — a man born into chaos, raised in silence, and left to navigate a world that never seemed to have a place for him. From childhood abuse to institutional betrayal, from addiction to redemption, from being invisible in the very places meant to protect him to finding fleeting moments of connection and courage — this is not just a memoir.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a testimony to survival in the spaces between: between family and estrangement, between justice and injustice, between who you are told you are and who you might have been.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here you’ll find chapters of resilience and rage, humor and heartbreak — the moments that make up a life lived between the pages.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Ongoing Updates</h2>
  <p>I’ll be putting up supporting paperwork, emails, and documents as I go. There’s a lot of material, but I’ll do my best to get everything online as soon as possible. My aim is to have it ready in advance of the 6th of October, the date I intend to hold a peaceful act of civil disobedience. This will be a safe and non-violent protest — simply my way of drawing attention to the lifelong injustices I have faced at the hands of the State.</p>
